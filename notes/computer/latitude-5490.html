                <b>Linux Specific Configurations, Must Dos! (Debian)</b>
                <br>
                This laptop has some issues with power management on Linux from my experience, most notable when you close the lid or let things idle.
                Having used Windows and Linux, I don't have any strong preference besides the need for both on baremetal
                with different usecases. Disabling the integrated graphic's power management in grub is not ideal, however
                it has "dealt" with the issue. Keep in mind Linux was never really a desktop OS, and depending on the device you use there can be
                compromises like this made.

                <code>
                    $ vim /etc/default/grub
                    # Edit GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""
                    # e.g. GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet i915.enable_dc=0"
                    sudo update-grub
                </code>

                <b>Hardware</b>
                <br>
                Got some hardware recently to upgrade this device, unfortunately the CPU is soldered onto
                the motherboard. Inspite of that, the laptop is fairly repairable as long as you can scrounge
                for parts, and is extensible due to have slots for memory and storage. Intel 7th and 8th gen series
                are available, I opted for the 8th gen due to the quad core alongside with TPM 2.0 support,
                having originally used Windows 11 on the laptop until fairly recently.
            </p>

                <b>Memory & Storage</b>
                Keep in mind if you have a 7th gen CPU, the maximum frequency for ram is 2133MHz versus
                2400MHz for 8th gen. In my case I opted for Hynix SODIMM DDR4 (Unregistered), product
                code is HMA81G56AFR8N-UH from the vendor Hynix Semiconductor (Hyundai Electronics).
                This is verified to work with 8th gen cpus on this motherboard given that I bought another
                8GB stick to expand the amount of RAM, I have not tested other RAM since I only have DDR3 and maybe 2 for spares.

                Notice how the NVME slot, RAM slot, and battery are all serviceable? Just make sure to not
                rip off the screws when unscrewing the bottom panel, the screws are supposed to stay on the panel,
                they do not come off unless if something breaks!

            <p class="text-box">Just make sure to follow this picture when you are installing Linux, hit F12 key and enter BIOS,
                afterwards follow along this image to switch the SATA operation mode to AHCI to support the NVME
                drive. (Open image in new tab to enlarge). Menu: System Configuration > Sata Operation > AHCI.
