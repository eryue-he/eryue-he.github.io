            The Mabinogion consists of a multitude of stories that are quite entertaining to read.
            The stories are not sequential, instead they consist of discrete tales covering various
            subjects. In this page I will be recording down notes that I found useful when reading,
            usually that's not a thing that I do but the setting of Albion is relatively foreign
            to me despite having some exposure before as a youth to its ancient and medieval history.
            Historical events, cataclysmic shifts, major figures, I surely must know some, on the other hand 
            cultural aspects such as folklore remain a mystery to me.

                <b>Owain son of Urien (Owain mab Urien)</b>
                <br>
                Owain is referred to as Owain son of Urien (Urien Rheged), in the tale there are quite a 
                few references to real life figures, mythologized versions, and it all blurs together such
                as the inclusion of King Arthur. Owain historically was a king of North Rheged, where at the
                apex of its strength, they faced off against the kingdom of Bernicia (Angles) with Owain's
                most notable battles being that of the Battle of Alclud Ford and Argoed Llwyfain. Our character
                here however is portrayed more like a one man hero, one can say a romantic whom goes on quests
                and faces off against tough opposition whether it be the environment, broken promises, his questing 
                or his whole redemption arc. Owain most notably has been immortalized thanks to a poet by the name
                of Taliesin in the poem "Gweith Argoed Llwyfain". The most notable part of the poem goes like this:

                        When Owain slew Fflamddwyn,
                        it was no more to him than to sleep.
                        The wide host of England sleeps,
                        with the light in their eyes.

                    Fflamddwyn is an Angles, one of the leaders of the opposing warband that was slain by Owain 
                    in the battle of Argoed Llwyfain as retold in the poem above.

                <b>King Arthur (Brenin Arthur)</b>
                <br>
                King Arthur is frequently mentioned in medieval romances (literature and performance) well
                beyond that of the Mabinogion. One of the theories behind the "real life figure" is that he
                was a Romano-British warlord whom rallied the Romano-British and Celts to resist Anglo-Saxon
                incursions. In the context of the Welsh tales he is in charge of Camelot. Within Welsh tales
                he ranges from that of a warrior king to a magical figure. In French tales his role shifts
                from that have a warrior to one of primarily "doing nothing" where his inactivity leads to
                a flaw in an otherwise ideal Camelot. Given the variety of interpretations and tales from
                various authors, our character is sure to be varied, in The Mabinogion we have more of
                Geoffrey of Monmouth's influence which leans more towards the warrior king aspect.

                <br>
                Caer-Leon (City of Legions)
                <br>
                This is an old Roman legionary fortress, Romans when setting up fortifications like to establish
                all kinds of infrastructure that offer various ameneties akin to that of more permanent U.S. military
                bases so you'd have things such as taverns, baths, amphitheatres, offices, residential areas, granaries, etc.
                Given this, one will probably understand how Caerlleon Upon Usk makes for a comfortable position for
                Arthur and the whole Camelot group.

                <b>Countesses</b>
                In the text translated by Lady Charlotte Guest, if you read too quickly you might confuse the two countesses.
                One of the countesses is the subject of Owain's romance after he defeated the black knight (who turns out to
                be the spouse...üòû). This lady is what the whole tale is named after: The lady of the fountain. The other 
                lady mentioned is a  widowed countess whom is pretty much besieged by this Earl whom is seizing all of her land.
