            <h3>Compost</h3>
            <p class="text-box">
                <img src="../../images/sakura.png" alt="sakura"> Ratios - Approximately <30 nitrogen, >30 carbon.
                <br>
                <img src="../../images/sakura.png" alt="sakura">  Layer 50/50 ontop of rough base of sticks, ideally hay or dry grass, add bits of soil when you can
                Worms + isopods, ideally put them in to help process the compost.
                <br>
                <img src="../../images/sakura.png" alt="sakura">  Compost high in carbon entails: autumn leaves, straw, woodchips, sawdust, etc etc.
                <br>
                <img src="../../images/sakura.png" alt="sakura">  Compost high in nitrogen entails: vegtable scraps, coffee grounds, manure, etc.
                <br>
                <img src="../../images/sakura.png" alt="sakura">  Since I never passed chemistry, just remember that in terms of pH levels, low = acid, high = base, middle = neutral.
                Dimwit like me has to remember somehow lol.
                <br>
                <img src="../../images/sakura.png" alt="sakura"> Flowers that counteract some pests include, lavender & rosemary.

                <b>Florida Soil</b>
                <br>
                Most Floridian soils have low organic material, typically much less than 5%, in my locality this is
                fairly accurate, generally what I observe in smaller scale gardens is the heavy usage of compost, 
                additional soil bought elsewhere, ready made compost, and so forth (not counting large scale agriculture).
                Generally there is a "structureless" type of soil here, therefor it is more efficient long term (I'm too busy atm)
                to improve the soil structure within where one is growing crops. This solves the root of the issue
                and if you happen to have the time and resources, it is ideal. With better soil structure you can allow
                roots to penetrate better without having to deal with too much clay or giant rocks, etc. In our case
                Florida soil has high bulk density, compost and things of that nature is ideal. The proper classification of the soil should be spodosol or something along those lines
                which pretty much entails poor drainange, sand, clay, acid, etc. With low base saturation (< 35%) we are in for
                some pain, besides that however the weather and moisture is sufficient for growing crops, well at least
                the scallions grow alright for years at this point.
